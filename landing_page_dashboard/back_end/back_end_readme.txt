the backend will be written in Flask(Python) and will use MongoDB as primary database.
Stores the Image URL and the unix time in the MongoDB database.
Also extra functionality can be added that the old images can be automatically deleted from the Databse.

I think that Redis will be more suitable and It will also be good to prefer Redis over MongoDB here.
